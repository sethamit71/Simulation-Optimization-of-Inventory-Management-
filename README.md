key points:
Objective: To analyze the performance of (S,s) inventory policy across given design points using simulation 
          ●	Estimated long-run mean monthly cost and profit with a 95% CI by simulating (M,L) inventory policy over 100 months.
          ●	Compared system performance across 3 design points, namely excess Inventory policy, and value of M and L.
          ●	Implemented simulation optimization minimum mean monthly cost combination of M and L such that Fill Rate is > 99%.
